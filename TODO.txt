- Pad styling:
    - Colors (linear gradient)?

- Sounds:
    - Too late sounds ( check if have to cut or its just the test lag)


- General:
    - Loading ( loading app screen when linear gradient, etc.)
    - Loading sounds before app is ready !!!! (now using timeout)
    - Create on multitouch component for both Pads and Piano ( cant figure out how to pass isPressed for styling )
    - Top Options Styling !
Piano:
    - Landscape mode ? so far its fake, try to make it more resonable
    - Changing octaves - missing sounds, double loading !
Metronome:
    - Distance between sounds not even
